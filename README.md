# Manifold-Learning
Hi dudes, 
My majority is Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. My PhD dissertation title was "Combination of Manifold learning and Sparse Representation for Persian Handwritten Digits and Characters Recognition". I have had some expriences in using Manifold Learning (ML) methods in order to reduce the dimensionality of the high dimensional data. 
Manifold learning methods are kind of dimensional reduction methods which emphesize on preserving the structural features of the manifold in the low dimensional representation space. In this respority, Matlab code implementations of  common ML methods and my proposed ML methods (that have neen published) have been expressed.
List of the implemented manifold learning methods:
- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE),
- Laplacian Eigenmap (LEM),
- Mutual Neighborhood based LLE (MN-LLE),
- Mutual Neighborhood based LEM (MN-LEM),
- Diagonal Loading based LLE (DL-LLE),
- Stochastic LEM (SLEM),
- Fusion of SLEM and LLE (FSLL)
