# Manifold-Learning
Hi dudes, 

My majority is Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. My Ph.D. dissertation title was "Combination of Manifold learning and Sparse Representation for Persian Handwritten Digits and Characters Recognition". I have had some experiences in using Manifold Learning (ML) methods in order to reduce the dimensionality of the high dimensional data. Manifold learning methods are kind of dimensional reduction methods which emphasize preserving the structural features of the manifold in the low dimensional representation space. In this repository, Matlab codes of common ML methods and my proposed ML methods (that have been published) have been expressed. 
List of the implemented manifold learning methods:
-	Locally Linear Embedding (LLE),
-	Laplacian Eigenmap (LEM),
-	Mutual Neighborhood based LLE (MN-LLE),
-	Mutual Neighborhood based LEM (MN-LEM),
-	Diagonal Loading based LLE (DL-LLE),
-	Stochastic LEM (SLEM),
-	Fusion of SLEM and LLE (FSLL)
